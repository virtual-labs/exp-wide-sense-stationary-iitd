      "question": "1. A signal has a mean of 5 and a variance that fluctuates over time. Can this signal be considered wide-sense stationary (WSS)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Yes, if the autocorrelation depends only on the time difference.",
        "b": "No, because the variance is not constant.",
        "c": "Yes, if the mean and variance are time-invariant on average.",
        "d": "No, because WSS requires both mean and variance to be constant."
      },

        "a": "WSS also requires constant mean and variance.",
        "b": "Variance fluctuations violate WSS conditions.",

        "a": "WSS assumes higher-order moments are time-invariant.",
        "b": "SSS requires constant mean and variance, while WSS does not.",

        "a": "Higher-order moments are not considered in WSS.",
        "b": "WSS also requires constant mean and variance.",
